## Psychopathy
Psychopathy is hereby defined as a person being subject to traumatic events that leads to memory loss and various symptoms. The degree of psychopathy is the amount and severeness of traumatic events.

Visual and auditory hallucinations, false reality judgement, neurotic tics, tourettes syndrome, ADHD, OCD, Epilepsi, Autism, and in general, all psychological disturbances can be explained as a combination of traumatic events. The diagnosis depends on the kind and severity of traumas. The root diagnosis is memory loss leading to empathic deficiency, psychosis, schitzoferina and the multitude of descriptions found in the DSM-5 [1].

The traumas may seem genetically hereditary, but the reality is that people tend to subject their offspring to violence of a similar kind as they themselfes were subjected to. Trauma causes unawareness. The unawareness of the event causes strong tempations that urge a person into commiting acts of violence or to repeat the pattern of trauma. The gentic factor is explained by epigenetics [2].

All conditions are hereby treated as a form of psychopathy, with following ailments.

### Isolation
Isolation is an important step in rehabilitating the mind into a corrected state of reality judgement. Reality is the world experienced by the senses. There are no objective rules in life other than the limits afforded by the body and nature. In order to come into an objective reality judgement, one needs to deal with matters if idolization.

Idolization is the belief that there are any other rules in life than what is afforded by body and nature. Examples of such rules is the belief in the authority of the state and state employees. Belief in parental advice. Belief in religious doctrine. Belief in group identities. 

Idolization is prevalent among most adults. It hinders the mind from seeing the world clearly and fairly. Those who are obsessed by idolization tend to place utmost importance on institutional thinking. This kind of thinking suspends individual judgement of moral values in favor of majority rule.

Isolation is necessary to rehabilitate from idolatry. The main focus of isolation is usually parents, relatives and friends. These relationships usually have the strongest emotional impact. Entertainment, material wealth, and other mental distractions are all images of idolization. Isolation is neccessary to avoid unconscious manipulation and deception. Progression in rehabilitation requires isolation from habits. Regression is more likely when one is subjected to old habits.

### Facing Fears
##### Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)
CBT is academic slang for facing your fears. A matter complicated by scientific illiteracy. Facing fears is one step in our psychological development. Fears persist after trauma recovery. It is important for individuals to face their fears in their own desired pace. It is important to cultivate a healthy relationship to facing fears. A helpful mental frame is to be as slow as possible. To take it easy. As time goes by, the rate of expansion increases willingly. There is no rush. There is no need to obsess about doing anything. Doing nothing is as valid a strategy as any. 

### Living As You Please - Freedom
When we are subjected to trauma and societal indoctrination, we tend to live as others please instead of how we want to live our own lifes. Matters of marriage, family and work are aspects of human life that are mostly illusory. To brake free from this bondage, one needs to affirm to oneself to live as one pleases. 

I Live as I please. I decide how I live my life. Not my parents, not my spouse, not my religious group, not anyone, but ME. Others do not decide how I relate to other people. Others do not decide who I have sexual relationships with. I take responsibility for my life and I live as I please. 

If this is not the case, your are idolizing. 

### Linguistic Psychodiagnostic

Lingustic psychogiagnostic is a method to diagnose psychological vulnerabilities in a subject. The subject is presented with a random sentence. The sentence can be created using any method of random word selection. Nouns, verbs and adjectives are selected at random and connected using prepositions and conjunctions.

The subject is presented with a random sentence. Ideally, the sentence is presented in the subjects mother tounge together with visual queues to enchance the effect. The visual queue could be a Rorschach test [3] or any image that can have a triggering effect on the subject. Images of nationality and other group identities are reasonable strategies to test. In short, images that the subject has a relation to. Photos, arts etc...

Upon presenting the image and text, the patients emotional queues, body language and neurotic tendencies are observed. The patient can also be asked to explain the meaning of the sentence. The trial leader asks the patient to freely and openly share their thougts without censoring themselves. 

It is important that the patient knows that results of the test does not lead to repercussions. If the subject is unaware, the uncounscious thoughts and emotions may be projected onto the trial leader. The subject could believe that the trial leader is responsible for his or her reactions. The projections can be used to estimate the contents of traumatic memories.

### Example
A transmission of a car is used to select verbs and nouns. A transmission uses force to move cogs. The cogs have teeth. Cogs can move faster or slower, forward or backward. The teeth of the cogs hug while they move. 

#### Words
* Faster
* Force
* Forward 
* Hug
* Move
* Teeth

#### Random Sentence

## Cannabis Therapy
Cannabis (Marijuana) is a plant that has various mental and emotional effects on subjects depending on the mental state of the subject. When inhaled or prepared as an edible, the effects can range from psychotic and disturbing to enjoyable and satisfying. Disturbing effects are observed in patients with some degree of psychopathy. Higher degrees of psychopathy results in a higher likelyhood of paranoid delusions and disturbing emotions while under the effect of the substance.

Cannabis causes raised emotional awareness. During the effects, the subject is in a condition to better respond to therapeutic efforts. The dose must be determined on an individual basis. Ideally, the dose is low enough to keep the subject emotionally stable and safe, while being high enough to reach the desired effect. 

### Dealing with Psychosis and Anxiety
When a patient reaches a state of insight of traumatic events, psychotic symptoms and anxiety increase. At this point cannabis is used to further raise emotional awareness. The subject can then clearly feel anxious pains in various bodyparts. 

The subject uses the anxious pains as a guide to increase muscle tension in those areas. The tensions leads to the physical position of the traumatic event. While the subject adjusts into position, the tension focuses the anxiety and takes control of it. If the subject relaxes, the anxiety spreads and feels overwhelming. The subject then stays in the tensed up position and meditates on the emotion. Eventually, the memory is integrated into the psyche and the patient is relieved from the psychotic and anxious symptoms.

The process is repeated until all memories have been integrated. After completed therapy, the patient has a rich and beautiful emotional life, much like children.
