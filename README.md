# Psychology
Psychology is the scientific study of the human mind, body, and soul. In this treatise a theological world view is assumed and is crucial for understanding the human mind and body. The theological world view is that there is a soul that inhabits the body. The soul is independent from the body and the body can function independently of the soul.

## Definitions
### The Soul (Spirit)
The Soul is what is living. The body can function without a soul but is not alive in a theological sense.

### The Body
The body is used to denote the animal body with head, torso, arms and legs, or whatever form a body might take, be it a fish or a squirell or a human being. The word body can sometimes denote another type of body, like a body of water, or nature itself as the body of a planet. 

### The Mind
The mind is the thinking aspect of being. Thoughts are part of the mind and the brain. Mind and brain are not synonymous. The mind belongs to the soul. The brain belongs to the body. There are different planes of awareness in relation to the mind and the brain.

### The Brain
The brain is the physical organ in the human head and many other animals. It is responsible for controlling the body in a feedback loop of sensory input to output. The brain stores all sense impressions from forming of the first neuron and forward. The storage and control capacities increase as the number of neurons increase. The brain is controlled by the soul by means of intention. The soul guides the brain and body. If no soul is present, the brain repeats old patterns until a soul retakes the body.

### Trauma
A trauma is an event that has a horrifying effect on the subject. Traumatic events are often repressed. The subject that experienced the trauma does not necessarily remember it. Such a trauma leaves behind symptoms of stress. When a trauma occurs the subject tends to dissociate. This means that the soul temporarily leaves the body to cope with the stress.

### Psychopathy
Psychopathy is hereby defined as a person being subject to traumatic events that leads to memory loss and various symptoms. The degree of psychopathy is the amount and severeness of traumatic events.

Visual and auditory hallucinations, false reality judgement, neurotic tics, tourettes syndrome, ADHD, OCD, Epilepsi, Autism, and in general, all psychological disturbances can be explained as a combination of traumatic events. The diagnosis depends on the kind and severity of traumas. The root diagnosis is memory loss leading to empathic deficiency, psychosis, schitzoferina and the multitude of descriptions found in the DSM-5 [1].

Trauma may seem genetically hereditary, but the reality is that people tend to subject their offspring to violence of a similar kind as they themselfes were subjected to. Trauma causes unawareness. The unawareness of the event causes strong tempations that urge a person into commiting acts of violence or to repeat the pattern of trauma. The gentic factor is explained by epigenetics [2].

All conditions are hereby treated as a form of psychopathy, with following illness. Many somatic diseases have psychopathological [4] causes.

## Treatise
### Trauma
The question wheter you have been subject to childhood trauma or not is impossible to judge from memory alone. The child tends to repress the traumatic memories, and also the less flattering memories that would put one at odds with the parents and others. From the parents perspective, the child seems to forget, which can seem like no harm is being done. The harm is in fact adding over time which reflects in the childs emotional life. It is defeaning the subjects propspects of healthy living, reasonable boundary setting and pair boding.

The subjects behaviour becomes a manipulative survival mechanism that conforms to the environment. The manipulation is necessary to cope with life. When a child enters into adolescence and adulthood, the survival mechanism becomes a deficiency instead of an asset. Peers will sooner or later tire of the manipulative behaviour and the deficinecy becomes clearer as life moves forward.

As time passes by we become increasingly aware of our own deficiencies and are unable to get validation or find scapegoats for our own unsufficiencies. There is a rising pressure to deal with our faults. Dealing with our faults means dealing with the past injustices and coming to terms with human nature. The most prudent way forward is to forgive and seek reconciliation. In some cases one has to let go of past relationships. Reconsiliation is not always possible.

#### Isolation
Isolation is an important step in rehabilitating the mind into a corrected state of reality judgement. Reality is the world experienced by the senses. There are no objective rules in life other than the limits afforded by the body and nature. In order to come into an objective reality judgement, one needs to deal with matters if idolization.

Idolization is the belief that there are any other rules in life than what is afforded by body and nature. Examples of such rules is the belief in the authority of the state and state employees. Belief in parental advice. Belief in religious doctrine. Belief in group identities. 

Idolization is prevalent among most adults. It hinders the mind from seeing the world clearly and fairly. Those who are obsessed by idolization tend to place utmost importance on institutional thinking. This kind of thinking suspends individual judgement of moral values in favor of majority rule.

Isolation is necessary to rehabilitate from idolatry. The main focus of isolation is usually parents, relatives and friends. These relationships usually have the strongest emotional impact. Entertainment, material wealth, and other mental distractions are all images of idolization. Isolation is neccessary to avoid unconscious manipulation and deception. Progression in rehabilitation requires isolation from habits. Regression is more likely when one is subjected to old habits.

#### Projection
A major factor that reveals psychopathology is projections. Projections is a way for the mind to deny its own faults by seeing the faults in others. If a person has an emotional judgement about another, the judgement is likely directed towards the unconscious self. It is evident in manipulation tactics when someone pretends to understand the thoughts and inner motivations of another. In most cases, these kinds of statements are unconscious projections.

True discernment of anothers inner motivations are possible, but it required a deeper analysis based factual evidence. A good understanding of language and human expression is neccessary.

To uncover your own unconscious ideas, it is necessary to put pride aside and be willing to accept your own insufficiencies. One method of development is to willingly project in writing, speech, or arts. An example of this is to write a text about people that we hate and try to flow in hatred. When we are done writing there is much to learn about ourselfes. The intentions and thoughs we put on others are likely our own.

It is common to feel bad about having to realize our projections. A way to cope with the guilt is to remember that it is not your fault. Everything has an explanation. Everything has a cause. Being Loving and compassionate to one self can be difficult but a necessary skill to develop.

Projections can also be good. People tend to see ones own flattering aspects in other people and not see it in the self. It is a good excercise to accept self flattery. Try to see the good you see in others in yourself. 

Projection is the swiss army knife of psychology. Learn to tame it.

#### Imagination
Imagination is an effective tools too uncover inner desires and motivations. One can either imagine by conssciously enter into imagination, or let the mind create an imagination and observe it. 

A technique is to be in a comfortable position and let the mind wander. Another technique is to hold and image in the mind and try not to imagine anything. Eventually the image animates itself and becomes like a movie in the mind. It is important to do these excercises in a pleasurable way. Make sure you have time, spaceâ€š privacy and a neutral emotional state.

Seeing the imagination is one aspect of the show. Analyzing its meaning is another. Some imaginations can also call for conscious action. Like a lucid dream. The dreamer has partial control of the show. 

Imagination of this kind requires patiente and virtue. A childlike willingness to explore the inner without judgement.

Whatever excerise you do, do it in your own time and pace. If you only can lie still for 10 seconds, that is sufficient. Do not make excessive demands on yourself. Respect your emotions. 

#### Consider All Thoughts
There are many kinds of thoughs to consider, ranging from wonderful to horrible. It can be difficult to consider thoughts in lack of virtue. In fear of self humiliation. Give yourself the approval you need to consider all and any thoughts. 

#### Negations
A way to uncover unconscious desires is to consider the things we say we don't want or need. When we use negations in speech, the thing being negated is not arbitrary. Of all the thing that are not, we choose some specific not.

Example: I don't want to become a rockstar.

This usually means you wan to be a rockstar, but you fear accepting the desire. The fear of failure keeps us not wanting things we actually want. 

Be wary of your nots. Remove the not, and see how it sounds. 


#### Symbolic Thinking
...

#### Facing Fears
##### Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)
CBT is academic slang for facing your fears. A matter complicated by scientific illiteracy. Facing fears is one step in our psychological development. Fears persist after trauma recovery. It is important for individuals to face their fears in their own desired pace. It is important to cultivate a healthy relationship to facing fears. A helpful mental frame is to be as slow as possible. To take it easy. As time goes by, the rate of expansion increases willingly. There is no rush. There is no need to obsess about doing anything. Doing nothing is as valid a strategy as any. 

##### Affirmation
###### Living As You Please
When we are subjected to trauma and societal indoctrination, we tend to live as others please instead of how we want to live our own lifes. Matters of marriage, family and work are aspects of human life that are mostly illusory. To brake free from this bondage, one needs to affirm to oneself to live as one pleases. 

I Live as I please. I decide how I live my life. Not my parents, not my spouse, not my religious group, not anyone, but ME. Others do not decide how I relate to people. Others do not decide who I have sexual relationships with. I take responsibility for my life and I live as I please. 

#### Linguistic Psychodiagnostic

Lingustic psychogiagnostic is a method to diagnose psychological vulnerabilities in a subject. The subject is presented with a random sentence. The sentence can be created using any method of random word selection. Nouns, verbs and adjectives are selected at random and connected using prepositions and conjunctions.

The subject is presented with a random sentence. Ideally, the sentence is presented in the subjects mother tounge together with visual queues to enchance the effect. The visual queue could be a Rorschach test [3] or any image that can have a triggering effect on the subject. Images of nationality and other group identities are reasonable strategies to test. In short, images that the subject has a relation to. Photos, arts etc...

Upon presenting the image and text, the patients emotional queues, body language and neurotic tendencies are observed. The patient can also be asked to explain the meaning of the sentence. The trial leader asks the patient to freely and openly share their thougts without censoring themselves. 

It is important that the patient knows that the results of the test does not lead to repercussions. If the subject is unaware, the uncounscious thoughts and emotions may be projected onto the trial leader. The subject could believe that the trial leader is responsible for his or her reactions. The projections can be used to estimate the contents of traumatic memories.

#### Example
A transmission of a car is used to select verbs and nouns. A transmission uses force to move cogs. The cogs have teeth. Cogs can move faster or slower, forward or backward. The teeth of the cogs hug while they move. 

##### Words
* Faster
* Force
* Forward 
* Hug
* Move
* Teeth

##### Random Sentence
Move the force and hug forward with teeth but faster

### Cannabis Therapy
Cannabis (Marijuana) is a plant that has various mental and emotional effects on subjects depending on the mental state of the subject. When inhaled or prepared as an edible, the effects can range from psychotic and disturbing to enjoyable and satisfying. Disturbing effects are observed in patients with some degree of psychopathy. Higher degrees of psychopathy results in a higher likelyhood of paranoid delusions and disturbing emotions while under the effect of the substance.

Cannabis causes raised emotional awareness. During the effects, the subject is in a condition to better respond to therapeutic efforts. The dose must be determined on an individual basis. Ideally, the dose is low enough to keep the subject emotionally stable and safe, while being high enough to reach the desired effect. 

#### Dealing with Psychosis and Anxiety
When a patient reaches a state of insight of traumatic events, psychotic symptoms and anxiety increase. At this point cannabis is used to further raise emotional awareness. The subject can then clearly feel anxious pains in various bodyparts. 

The subject uses the anxious pains as a guide to increase muscle tension in those areas. The tensions leads to the physical position of the traumatic event. While the subject adjusts into position, the tension focuses the anxiety and takes control of it. If the subject relaxes, the anxiety spreads and feels overwhelming. The subject then stays in the tensed up position and meditates on the emotion. Eventually, the memory is integrated into the psyche and the patient is relieved from the psychotic and anxious symptoms.

The process is repeated until all memories have been integrated. After completed therapy, the patient gains higher muscle control. It feels like being more centered and aware in the body.
