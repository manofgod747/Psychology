## Psychopathy
Psychopathy is hereby defined as a person being subject to traumatic events that leads to memory loss. The degree of psychopathy is the amount and severeness of the traumatic events. All psychiatric diagnosis are explained by this definition of psychopathy. 

Visual and auditory hallucinations, false reality judgement, neurotic tics, tourettes syndrome, ADHD, Epilepsi, Autism, and in general, all psychological disturbances can be explained as a combination of traumatic events. The diagnosis depends on the kind and severity of traumas. The root diagnosis is memory loss leading to empathic deficiency. 

The traumas may seem genetically hereditary, but the reality is that people tend to subject their offspring to violence of a similar kind as they themselfes were subjected to. Trauma causes unawareness. The unawareness of the event causes strong tempations that urge a person into commiting acts of violence. The gentic factor is explained by epigenetics [2].

## Linguistic Psychodiagnostic

Lingustic psychogiagnostic is a method to diagnose psychological vulnerabilities in a subject. The subject is presented with a random sentence. The sentence can be created using any method of random word selection. Nouns, verbs and adjectives are selected at random and connected using prepositions and conjunctions.

The subject is presented with a random sentence. Ideally, the sentence is presented in the subjects mother tounge together with visual queues to enchance the effect. The visual queue could be a Rorschach test [1] or any image that can have a triggering effect on the subject. Images of nationality and other group identities are reasonable strategies to test. In short, images that the subject has a relation to. Photos, arts etc...

Upon presenting the image and text, the patients emotional queues, body language and neurotic tendencies are observed. The patient can also be asked to explain the meaning of the sentence. The trial leader asks the patient to freely and openly share their thougts without censoring themselves. 

It is important that the patient knows that results of the test does not lead to repercussions. If the subject is unaware, the uncounscious thoughts and emotions may be projected onto the trial leader. The subject could believe that the trial leader is responsible for his or her reactions. The projections can be used to estimate the contents of traumatic memories.

### Example - Cog World
A transmission of a car is used to select verbs and nouns. A transmission uses force to move cogs. The cogs have teeth. Cogs can move faster or slower, forward or backward. The teeth of the cogs hug while they move. 

#### Words
* Faster
* Force
* Forward 
* Hug
* Move
* Teeth

#### Random Sentence

## Cannabis Therapy
Cannabis (Marijuana) is a plant that has various mental and emotional effects on subjects depending on the mental state of the subject. When inhaled or prepared as an edible, the effects can range from psychotic and disturbing to enjoyable and satisfying. Disturbing effects are observed in patients with some degree of psychopathy. Higher degrees of psychopathy results in a higher likelyhood of paranoid delusions and disturbing emotions while under the effect of the substance.

Cannabis causes raised emotional awareness. During the effects, the subject is in a condition to better respond to therapeutic efforts. The dose must be determined on an individual basis. Ideally, the dose is low enough to keep the subject emotionally stable and safe, and high enough to reach the desired effect. 

### Dealing with Psychosis and Anxiety
When a patient reaches a state of insight of traumatic events, psychotic symptoms and anxiety increase. At this point cannabis is used to further raise emotional awareness. The subject can then clearly feel anxious pains in various bodyparts. 

The subject uses the anxious pains as a guide to increase muscle tension in those areas. The tensions leads to the physical position of the traumatic event. While the subject adjusts into position, the tension focuses the anxiety and takes control of it. If the subject relaxes, the anxiety spreads and feels overwhelming. The subject then stays in the tensed up position and meditates on the emotion. Eventually, the memory is integrated into the psyche and the patient is relieved from the psychotic and anxious symptoms.

The process is repeated until all memories have been integrated. After completed therapy, the patient has a rich and beautiful emotional life, much like children.
